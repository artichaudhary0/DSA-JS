Basic Binary Search Questions
Binary Search in a Sorted Array

Given a sorted array and a target value, write a function that returns the index of the target value in the array. If the target is not found, return -1.
Example: Input: arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], target = 7; Output: 3
Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

Given a sorted array of integers, find the starting and ending position of a given target value. If the target is not found, return [-1, -1].
Example: Input: arr = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], target = 8; Output: [3, 4]
Count Occurrences of an Element in a Sorted Array

Given a sorted array, count the number of occurrences of a target element.
Example: Input: arr = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5], target = 2; Output: 3
Square Root of a Number

Implement integer square root calculation using binary search. Given an integer x, return the integer part of the square root of x.
Example: Input: x = 8; Output: 2
Peak Element in an Array

Find a peak element in an unsorted array. A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.
Example: Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 1]; Output: 2
Intermediate Binary Search Questions
Search in Rotated Sorted Array

A sorted array was rotated at an unknown pivot. Given this rotated array and a target value, return the index of the target value. If not found, return -1.
Example: Input: arr = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], target = 0; Output: 4
Minimum Element in Rotated Sorted Array

Find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array. Assume all elements are distinct.
Example: Input: arr = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]; Output: 1
Find the Closest Element to a Target in a Sorted Array

Given a sorted array and a target, find the element that is closest to the target. If there are two elements with equal distance to the target, return the smaller one.
Example: Input: arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], target = 6; Output: 5
Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix

Given an n x n matrix where each row and column is sorted in ascending order, find the k-th smallest element in the matrix.
Example: Input: matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8; Output: 13
Advanced Binary Search Question
Median of Two Sorted Arrays
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays. Aim for a solution with O(log(min(m, n))) complexity.
Example: Input: nums1 = [1, 3], nums2 = [2]; Output: 2.0
