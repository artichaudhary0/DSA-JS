What is Binary Search?
Can you explain the concept of binary search and how it differs from linear search?

Binary Search Implementation
How would you implement binary search in JavaScript to find an element in a sorted array?

Edge Case Handling
How does your binary search function handle cases where the target value is not present in the array?

Time Complexity
What is the time complexity of binary search, and why is it more efficient compared to other search algorithms?

Binary Search Recursive Approach
Can you write a recursive version of binary search in JavaScript?

Binary Search on Floating-Point Numbers
How would you modify binary search to work with arrays containing floating-point numbers?

Binary Search with Duplicates
How would you modify the binary search algorithm to return the first occurrence of a target element if duplicates are present in the array?

Binary Search in 2D Arrays
How would you adapt binary search to search for a target value in a 2D matrix, where each row and column is sorted?

Finding Range of Values
How can binary search be used to find the range (start and end indices) of a target element in a sorted array?

Binary Search on Rotated Arrays
How would you use binary search to find an element in a sorted and rotated array?
