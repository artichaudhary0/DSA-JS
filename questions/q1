1. Median in a Stream of Integers
You are given a stream of integers, and you need to find the median of the elements at any given point in time.
Constraints: The stream can contain up to 10^6 elements.
Hints: Use a combination of min-heap and max-heap.
2. Trapping Rainwater Problem 
Given n non-negative integers representing the heights of blocks, compute how much water can be trapped after raining.
Example Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Hints: Use two-pointer technique or precompute maximum heights.
3. Maximum Subarray XOR
Given an array of integers, find the subset of elements that gives the maximum XOR.
Constraints: Array size can be 10^5.
Hints: Use a trie for efficient XOR computation.
4. Minimum Window Substring
Given two strings s and t, find the minimum window in s which contains all the characters of t.
Example Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Hints: Use sliding window and hash maps.
5. Word Break Problem
Given a string and a dictionary of words, determine if the string can be segmented into space-separated words from the dictionary.
Example Input: s = "leetcode", dict = ["leet", "code"]
Output: true
Hints: Use dynamic programming.

9. Edit Distance Problem
Find the minimum number of operations (insert, delete, substitute) to convert string a into string b.
Example Input: a = "horse", b = "ros"
Output: 3 (horse → rorse → rose → ros)
Hints: Use dynamic programming.
10. Segment Tree with Lazy Propagation
